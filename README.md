# iframe-tracking
Postmessage system for iframe tracking via GTM.

## Requirements
In order to use this system of passing events and information between 2 frames you must have access to add or modify javascript on both the parent page and the iframe. 

This can be accomplished either through GTM containers or direct file access. 

## How to use

Instructions coming soon.


## Demo

An example using direct implmentation (without GTM) can be viewed [here](#).

## Files
